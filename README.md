# Projeto-Lista-de-Compras

<p>Here we made a shopping list using getElementById, createElement and appendChild to manipulate the DOM and display the elements on the page, and also doc constants and listOfProducts to store the document and the list of products, respectively.
A simple but very enlightening project.
